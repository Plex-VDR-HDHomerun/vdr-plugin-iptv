Requirements:

IPTV patched VDR-1.5.9+ and multicast/unicast transport streams

Description:

This plugin integrates multicast IPTV transport streams seamlessly into
VDR. You can use any IPTV channel like any other normal DVB channel for
live viewing, recording, ...

Currently the IPTV plugin supports multicast UDP/RTP and unicast HTTP
streams. Also a file input method is supported, but file delay must be
selected individually to prevent VDR's transfer buffer over/underflow.
Therefore it should be considered as a testing feature only.

Installation:

cd /put/your/path/here/VDR/PLUGINS/src
tar -xzf /put/your/path/here/vdr-iptv-X.Y.Z.tgz
ln -s iptv-X.Y.Z iptv
cd /put/your/path/here/VDR
patch -p1 < PLUGINS/src/iptv/patches/vdr-1.5.x-closefilter.patch
patch -p1 < PLUGINS/src/iptv/patches/vdr-1.5.x-pluginparam.patch
cp sources.conf /path/to/vdrconf/
make
make plugins
./vdr -P iptv

Setup menu:

- TS buffer size [MB] = 2          Defines ringbuffer size for transport
                                   stream in MB.
                                   The valid range: 1...4
- TS buffer prefill ratio [%] = 0  Defines prefill ratio for transport
                                   stream ringbuffer before data is
                                   transferred to VDR.
                                   The valid range: 0...40
- Use section filtering = 1        Defines whether section filtering shall
                                   be used.
                                   The valid range: 0...1
- Scan Sid automatically = 1       Defines whether service id shall be
                                   scanned automatically. Requires section
                                   filtering.
                                   The valid range: 0...1
- Disable filters = 0              Certain section filters might have some
                                   unwanted behaviour. This option allows you
                                   to blacklist them. If this option is set
                                   to a non-zero value, the menu page will
                                   contain that many "Disable filter" options
                                   which allow you to disable the individual
                                   section filters.
                                   The valid range: 0...7

- UDP multicast rules for iptables firewall

  # Multicast UDP -packets
  iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p udp -d 224.0.0.0/4 --dport 1234 -j ACCEPT

  # IGMP required by multicasts
  iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p igmp -d 224.0.0.0/4 -j ACCEPT

Notes:

- Working EIT requires correct Nid/Tid/Sid values as the NIT filter cannot
  determine the type (satellite/cable/terrestrial) of the IPTV transport
  stream.

- The following section filters are recommended to be disabled:
  "NIT (0x40)", "SDT (0x42)", "TDT (0x70)"
