Requirements:

An IPTV patched VDR-1.5.10 (or later) setup and DVB compatible MPEG1/2
network video streams.

Description:

This plugin integrates multicast IPTV transport streams seamlessly into
VDR. You can use any IPTV channel like any other normal DVB channel for
live viewing, recording, etc. The plugin also features full section
filtering capabilities which allow for example EIT information to be
extracted from the incoming stream.

Currently the IPTV plugin supports both multicast UDP/RTP and unicast
HTTP MPEG1/2 transport streams. Also a file input method is supported,
but a file delay must be selected individually to prevent VDR's transfer
buffer over/underflow. Therefore the file input should be considered
as a testing feature only.

Installation:

cd /put/your/path/here/VDR/PLUGINS/src
tar -xzf /put/your/path/here/vdr-iptv-X.Y.Z.tgz
ln -s iptv-X.Y.Z iptv
cd /put/your/path/here/VDR
patch -p1 < PLUGINS/src/iptv/patches/vdr-X.Y.Z-pluginparam.patch
cp sources.conf /path/to/vdrconf/
make
make plugins
./vdr -P iptv

Setup menu:

- TS buffer size [MB] = 2          Defines ringbuffer size for transport
                                   stream in MB.
                                   Valid range: 1...4
- TS buffer prefill ratio [%] = 0  Defines prefill ratio for transport
                                   stream ringbuffer before data is
                                   transferred to VDR.
                                   The valid range: 0...40
- Use section filtering = 1        Defines whether section filtering shall
                                   be used.
                                   Valid range: 0...1
- Scan Sid automatically = 1       Defines whether service id shall be
                                   scanned automatically. Requires section
                                   filtering.
                                   Valid range: 0...1
- Disable filters = 0              Certain section filters might cause some
                                   unwanted behaviour to VDR such as time
                                   being falsely synchronized etc. This
                                   option allows creation of blacklists of
                                   ill-behaving filters. If this option is
                                   set to a non-zero value, the menu page
                                   will contain that many "Disable filter"
                                   options which allow you to disable the
                                   individual section filters.
                                   Valid range: 0...7
- [Red:Channels]                   Opens IPTV channel editor.
- [Blue:Info]                      Opens IPTV information/statistics menu.

Channel editor menu:

- Because of the different nature and content the VDR channel editor is not
  best suited for editing of IPTV channels. Therefore an alternative editor
  is provided which allows more IPTV centric editing of channel information.
  An IPTV channel editor is accessible via "Setup -> Plugins -> IPTV" and
  pressing the Red button. The channel editor is functionally similar to
  VDR's built-in channel editor.

Information menu:

- [Red:General]                    Opens the general information page.
- [Green:Pids]                     Opens the pid statistics page.
- [Yellow:Filters]                 Opens the section filter statistics page.
- [Blue:Bits/bytes]                Toggles between bits and bytes mode.

- UDP multicast rules for iptables firewall

  # Multicast UDP -packets
  iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p udp -d 224.0.0.0/4 --dport 1234 -j ACCEPT

  # IGMP required by multicasts
  iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p igmp -d 224.0.0.0/4 -j ACCEPT

Notes:

- Working EIT requires correct Nid/Tid/Sid values as the NIT filter cannot
  determine the type (satellite/cable/terrestrial) of the IPTV transport
  stream.

- The following section filters are recommended to be disabled:
  "NIT (0x40)", "SDT (0x42)", "TDT (0x70)"

Acknowledgements:

- The IPTV section filtering code is derived from Linux kernel.
